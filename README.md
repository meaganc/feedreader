# Project Overview

* To run the Jasmine specs, navigate to the index. These tests evaluate that the feed reader's feeds are defined and are displayed on load, that the feed loads new feeds appropriately, and that the menu can be hidden and re-shown on click.
* Initially, the app loads the Udacity blog feed, but the user can switch between feeds by clicking on the hamburger menu in the left hand corner, and then selecting a new feed from the slider menu.
